# Fit for TUM

### What it takes to pass your first exams...

##### How does studying work at TUM?

Don't underestimate the amount of change in life! Be responsible, make new friends and get used to the culture. It can be a challenge, especially when coming from a foreign country, and change is not always easy: during the first semester there might be hard times, feeling lonely, but it's normal and it goes by.

Five golden rules:

* *Take studying seriously* - just enough courses, developing and reviewing the studying routine;
* *Manage your time* - you decide when to go to lectures, which is a great freedom but also a great responsibility. Rule of thumb is 8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of leisure and chores, 8 hours of study or learning. A week plan is advised;
* *Develop an exam strategy* - start learning early enough and identify the optimal learning method for each subject: use old exams, practice dry runs and understand the structure of the test;
* *Explore the learning style* - not everything works for everyone, and people have different habits. Finding the right one (and the right environment) takes some time and exploring;
* *Take care of yourself* - enjoy student and everyday life while taking care of health and making friends.
